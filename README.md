Dragon shared scripts
=========

- speaking: simple tool to use Windows narrator to read a predefine script in a text file. It supports a way to pause/sleep between read/speak times.

- HTMLParser: is a helper class to support parsing and manipulation HTML string, one of its remarkable feature is auto detect/solve the missing open tags which is a common and headache issue of HTML content.

- idiff: A modified version of http://www.phpied.com/image-diff/ to support Fuzzy comparison (with threshold) instead of comparing identically pixel per pixel

- SmartBackup: a simple .bat file with predefine parameters for Windows's Robocopy to do the job of mirroring things.

- FrontPage4githut-io: MS FrontPage came with paths having prefix with `_` (e.g.: _derived, _overlay, _themes) and they are not compatible or support by github.io (e.g.: 404 return code when accessing in browser). This script will search and rename such those folders and modify the linkings (e.g.: href, src) in htm files to solve that problem.

- download_file: a simple script to test file content serving/downloading from a server. Please caustious as this is kind of stress/load test and may slow down a server during testing.
